## Tool and Techniques
In this project, Power BI was the primary and sole tool used for data analysis, visualization, and reporting. Power BI’s comprehensive suite of features allowed for a streamlined work-flow, covering all stages from data ingestion to dashboard creation and sharing.

##Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The Power Query Editor provided a robust environment for data cleaning and preprocessing, enabling tasks like filtering, renaming columns, merging datasets, and handling missing values without needing external datacleaning tools.

### Data Modeling:
Power BI’s relationship modeling tools enabled linking related tables, making it possible to analyze data across multiple tables without leaving the Power BI environment.

### Visualizations: 
Power BI’s extensive library of visualization options like bar charts, and heatmaps allowed me to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard to convey insights effectively.
### DAX for Calculations:
With Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), I could create complex calcu-lations and measures directly in Power BI, allowing for advanced analysis without the need for external scripting.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. After downloading, I performed a series of cleaning steps to ensure the data's accuracy and relevance to the specific problem being addressed. 

## Data Cleaning
Removing irrelevant columns or rows that did not contribute to the analysis.

Handling missing values by either imputing them with relevant statistical measures or remov-ing incomplete entries, depending on the context.

Standardizing data formats to ensure consistency across fields.

Correcting inaccuracies or inconsistencies to better align the dataset with the requirements of the analysis.

## Data Transformation and Modelling
To better align the dataset with the analytical needs of this project, I created additional tables that reorganized and structured the data for effective analysis and modelling. This process involved:

Defining a new table structure that highlighted key attributes relevant to solving the problem, which included [Name of week, Day name, Month Name, Year].

Synthesizing data from the original dataset into this new table to better capture patterns, rela-tionships crucial to the problem at hand.

### Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends

Sales volumes are consistently higher on weekends compared to weekdays, indicating that most customers prefer shopping during leisure time.
Sales on Saturdays and Sundays account for approximately 40% of weekly revenue, with peak sales observed in the late morning and early afternoon.

### Sales Analysis by Store Location
While all locations are doing well, focused strategies in lower performance areas could further optimize sales across the board.
Hell’s Kitchen show significantly higher sales volumes than Low Manhattan and Astoria locations. The top-performing Hell’s Kitchen store has 30% more revenue than the highest-performing Low Manhattan store.

### Daily Sales Analysis with Average Line
![DAILY](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a099093-b931-45e1-8261-051d424f5517)

While daily sales fluctuate, there is a noticeable mid-week dip, where sales drop about 10% below the daily average line. Conversely, Saturdays consistently exceed the average line.
Sales rise towards the end of the week, with peak activity on Saturdays, suggesting an opportunity for promotions on slower days to maintain consistency.

### Sales Analysis by Product Category
Coffee sales lead across all categories, accounting for over 50% of total sales, followed by Tea 30% and bakery items 14%. 
Beverage sales are highest in urban stores, while snack items perform consistently across all store locations.

### Top 10 Products by Sales
The top 10 products account for 35% of total sales, dominated by popular espresso drinks and fast-selling Tea. These items drive much of the store’s revenue, emphasizing the importance of inventory availability for these products.

### Sales Analysis by Days and Hours
Sales peak during morning hours (7 AM to 11AM) and early evening (3 PM to 6 PM), particularly on weekends. The lowest sales hours are typically between 6 AM and 7 PM across all days.
The data indicates strong morning and evening traffic, suggesting customers primarily visit stores before or after work.

## Recommendations
Promotions and Discounts on Weekdays Implement targeted promotions on weekdays, especially Tuesdays, to drive traffic during typically slower days. Consider offering weekday loyalty rewards or discounts.

Adjust Inventory by Store Location Allocate higher inventory of top-selling espresso to Hell’s Kitchen locations, given their higher demand, while maintaining balanced stock for Low Manhattan and Astoria stores.

Launch Mid-Week Specials To counter mid-week dips, introduce a “Mid-Week Special” promotion to attract more customers on slower days. This could include discounts on beverages or “buy one, get one” offers on selected items.

Focus on Top Products in Promotions Increase promotion efforts for the top 10 products, emphasizing them in marketing materials and loyalty rewards to boost sales even further.
Extend Hours During Peak Times for Urban Stores Given the higher traffic during peak morning and evening hours, consider extending operating hours slightly on weekends or Fridays to capture additional sales.

Product Offerings by Season Tailor product offerings to meet seasonal demand. For example, increase stock and promote cold beverages in summer, while introducing warmer seasonal drinks during winter.

Encourage Traffic with Time-Based Discounts Since 6 AM and 7 PM shows low sales, consider a “Happy Hour” discount for those hours to encourage visits.

## Conclusion
The sales analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences by time, product category, and location. The data reveals a strong preference for shopping on weekends, high demand for beverages, and peak traffic during morning and evening hours. By focusing on targeted weekday promotions, optimizing inventory by location, and promoting top products, the business can enhance revenue, balance traffic across hours and days, and improve customer satisfaction. Seasonal adjustments and tailored store hours further align with customer needs, positioning the business for continued growth and profitability.
